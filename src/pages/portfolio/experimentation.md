## PlayStation | Sr Product Manager

I led product development for the internal ab testing tool, a platform to setup, run, and measure new service releases, and more. The vision was to enable data-driven decision-making at scale and accelerate innovation.

## Overview

PlayStation delivers interactive entertainment through gaming consoles, software, and online services for 108+ million users globally. It offers a platform for gamers to experience immersive stories, engage in competitive play, and connect with a global community.

## Problem

A year after the launch of PlayStation 5 console, these problems remain to **deliver the best gamer experience**:

- Usability to buy, play, socialize on the the PlayStation Network (PSN) services
- Technical agility to launch with silos of repetitive ab testing builds
- Divided understanding of business due to different measurement methods and metrics
- Iterative, owner mindset
