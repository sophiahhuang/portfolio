# (BONUS) Shaping AB Testing Culture with Key Phrases

🙋🏻‍♀️ Hello!

👏🏻 A Warm welcome for those who came from Growth Hacker Conference.

💻 I'm exploring virtual conferences and content creation for the first time! Two slides were omitted for time, but adopting this language is essential. Use these phrases daily to cultivate your desired A/B testing culture.

🚰 I'd deeply value your feedback or any growth hacking insights.

💬 Feel free to contact via email or X.

> 1. **I just know, based on **\_\_**.**

- Fallacy callout 1: Trusting intuition over data overlooks data-driven insights, forfeiting chances to enhance customer understanding.
- Fallacy callout 2: Past insights don't always fit today's context. In our rapid market shifts, innovative problem-solving technologies are crucial.

> 2. **This win proves the feature. Let's ship 100%. & vice versa**

- Fallacy callout 1: Small tests don't guarantee wide-scale success. Dive deeper into sub-segments; uplifts might not be universal.
- Fallacy callout 2: One market's success isn't global. Experiments might reflect particular local or regional instances; ongoing data checks and retests are vital. Assessing effects quarterly discerns splash from tidal shifts.

> 3. **That’s always the way we’ve done it.**

- Fallacy callout 1: Sticking to tradition can hinder innovation and optimization. Embracing collaboration sparks unexpected breakthroughs.
- Fallacy callout 2: Reluctance to change limits adaptability and growth. Welcoming diverse input can boost team efficiency and nurture collective ownership.
