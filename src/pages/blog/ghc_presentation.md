# Experimental Growth's 3 Big Roadblocks

## The Triple ‘R’ Challenge of A/B Testing Culture: Resistance, Reality, and Resources

🚩 Every seasoned growth hacker hits roadblocks. In my CheapOair, Saks Fifth Ave, and PlayStation days, 3 stood out like sore thumbs: resistance, scarcity of resources, and those slap-in-the-face realities.

⚠️ People often resist new ideas; it’s like a reflex. And frustratingly, new hires often find themselves handcuffed, unable to enact the very change they were brought in for. Moreover, without the right tools or team processes, even genius growth strategies can falter. And then, there’s the big reality check, where our grand visions meet the real world—and sometimes, it’s a true balancing act to keep your stakeholders aligned and committed along the way until those home runs materialize.

🏁 I took the stage at GrowthHackers Conference 2023 to spotlight these challenges and provide actionable solutions. My motivation? **To pay forward to the community that shaped me. By sharing these lessons from the trenches, I aim to fast-track the journey for my peers, enabling them to reach their A/B testing goals more quickly and confidently, with fewer detours.**

💭 Look forward to hearing your feedback or growth hacking insights with me!
