# Interview Prep Artifacts for 3 Different Types of Growth Strategy

🙋🏻‍♀️ Hi! I've moved into San Francisco Jan 2024.

💻 Sharing artifacts I created to prep for interviews in various problem spaces. AI-native solutions are being created at unprecedented speed. Users are surfing between a variety of products to trial and shop around. As novelty effects subside, businesses will need to focus on developing habit-forming experiences and identifying growth marketing levers to scale. Growth strategy encompasses the entire customer journey, including messaging, landing page, and funnel optimizations.
